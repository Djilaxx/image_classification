# Aerial cactus identification

This is a Kaggle competition hosted in 2019 (you can find the full detail [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification)). \
The dataset consist in 17.5k aerial images of cactus in a 32x32 image shape.\
The goal of the competition is to be able to classify those images whether they contain a cactus or not.
You must train a model, and then use it to make inference on the test set.  \
Your results are then evaluated by the area under the ROC curve metric.
