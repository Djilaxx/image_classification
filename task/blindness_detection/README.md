# Aptos 2019 blindness detection

This is a Kaggle competition from 2019 (you can find the full detail [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)). \
You are provided with a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions. \
Each image is classified for the severity of the diabetic retinopathy in the eye showed.
0 means no diabetic retinopathy, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, 3 is severe and 4 is proliferative. \
In the competition, your model score is determined using the quadratic weighted kappa metric.
